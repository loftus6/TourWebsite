## Capstone 490 Setup
Hello, this is my github for my capstone submission. The website is currently hosted at https://fairfieldhistory.com, but if that is down or you wish to create your own local version you can follow these steps.

#### Setup
If you are on windows, install visual studio and install the asp.net web development tools. I used .NET 8 as my version, which may be required for compatibility. 

Afterwards, open the sln with visual studio. If all goes well, the proper libraries should be includes and download automatically.
